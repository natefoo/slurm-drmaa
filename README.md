PSNC DRMAA for SLURM
====================

**Please note:** this is only [one slurm-drmaa user](https://github.com/natefoo/)'s import/clone and fork of the canonical [PSNC slurm-drmaa](http://apps.man.poznan.pl/trac/slurm-drmaa).

Introduction
------------

PSNC DRMAA for [Slurm Workload Manager (Slurm)](https://slurm.schedmd.com/) is an implementation of [Open Grid Forum](http://www.gridforum.org/) [DRMAA 1.0](http://www.drmaa.org/) (Distributed Resource Management Application API) [specification](http://www.ogf.org/documents/GFD.133.pdf) for submission and control of jobs to Slurm. Using DRMAA, grid applications builders, portal developers and ISVs can use the same high-level API to link their software with different cluster/resource management systems.

This software also enables the integration of [QCG-Computing](http://www.qoscosgrid.org/trac/qcg-computing/) with the underlying Slurm system for remote multi-user job submission and control over Web Services.

Although this fork is not the canonical source of slurm-drmaa, it has become mildly popular among the [Galaxy](http://galaxyproject.org/) community, especially as development on PSNC slurm-drmaa has slowed folliwing the death of the previous mantainer, Mariusz Mamonski. I will do my best to incorporate both upstream and contributed changes, but credit belongs to the original authors (found below). In this repository, I've imported the SVN history and attempted to attribute contributions correctly.

Download
--------

DRMAA for Slurm is distributed as a source package which can be downloaded via the [Releases](https://github.com/natefoo/slurm-drmaa/releases) section.

Installation
------------

To compile and install the library just go to main source directory and type:

```console
$ ./configure [options] && make
$ sudo make install
```

The library was tested with Slurm versions 14.03, 14.11, and 15.08. If you encountered any problems using the library on the different systems, please see the [contact](#contact) section.

Notable `./configure` script options:

> `--with-slurm-inc` SLURM\_INCLUDE\_PATH
>
> > Path to Slurm header files (i.e. directory containing `slurm/slurm.h` ). By default the library tries to guess the `SLURM_INCLUDE_PATH` and `SLURM_LIBRARY_PATH` based on location of the `srun` executable.

> `--with-slurm-lib` SLURM\_LIBRARY\_PATH
>
> > Path to Slurm libraries (i.e. directory containing `libslurm.a` ).

> `--prefix` INSTALLATION\_DIRECTORY
>
> > Root directory where PSNC DRMAA for Slurm shall be installed. When not given library is installed in `/usr/local`.

> `--enable-debug`
>
> > Compiles library with debugging enabled (with debugging symbols not stripped, without optimizations, and with many log messages enabled). Useful when you are to debug DRMAA enabled application or investigate problems with DRMAA library itself.

There are no unusual requirements for basic usage of library: ANSI C compiler and standard make program should suffice. If you have taken sources directly from this repository or wish to run test-suite you would need additional [developer tools](#developer-tools).

Configuration
-------------

During DRMAA session initialization (`drmaa_init`) library tries to read its configuration parameters from locations: `/etc/slurm_drmaa.conf`, `~/.slurm_drmaa.conf` and from file given in `SLURM_DRMAA_CONF` environment variable (if set to non-empty string). If multiple configuration sources are present then all configurations are merged with values from user-defined files taking precedence (in following order: `$SLURM_DRMAA_CONF`, `~/.slurm_drmaa.conf`, `/etc/slurm_drmaa.conf`).

Currently recognized configuration parameters are:

cache\_job\_state  
According to DRMAA specification every `drmaa_job_ps()` call should query DRM system for job state. With this option one may optimize communication with DRM. If set to positive integer `drmaa_job_ps()` returns remembered job state without communicating with DRM for `cache_job_state` seconds since last update. By default library conforms to the specification (no caching will be performed).

> Type: integer, default: 0

job\_categories  
Dictionary of job categories. Its keys are job categories names mapped to [native specification](#native-specification) strings. Attributes set by job category can be overridden by corresponding DRMAA attributes or native specification. Special category name `default` is used when `drmaa_job_category` job attribute was not set.

> Type: dictionary with string values, default: empty dictionary

### Configuration file syntax

Configuration file is in a form of a dictionary. Dictionary is set of zero or more key-value pairs. Key is a string while value could be a string, an integer or another dictionary.

```
  configuration: dictionary | dictionary_body
  dictionary: '{' dictionary_body '}'
  dictionary_body: (string ':' value ',')*
  value: integer | string | dictionary
  string: unquoted-string | single-quoted-string | double-quoted-string
  unquoted-string: [^ \t\n\r:,0-9][^ \t\n\r:,]*
  single-quoted-string: '[^']*'
  double-quoted-string: "[^"]*"
  integer: [0-9]+
```



Native specification
--------------------

DRMAA interface allows to pass DRM dependent job submission options. Those options may be specified directly by setting `drmaa_native_specification` job template attribute or indirectly by the `drmaa_job_category` job template attribute. The legal format of the native options looks like:

```
  -A My_job_name -s -N 1=10
```

List of parameters that can be passed in the `drmaa_native_specification` attribute:

### Known bugs and limitations

Library covers all [DRMAA 1.0 specification](http://www.ogf.org/documents/GFD.133.pdf) with exceptions listed below. It was successfully tested with [Slurm 14.03, 14.11, and 15.08](https://slurm.schedmd.com/). Known limitations:

-   `drmaa_control` options `DRMAA_CONTROL_HOLD`, `DRMAA_CONTROL_RELEASE` are only available for users being Slurm administrators (in version prior 2.2)
-   `drmaa_control` options `DRMAA_CONTROL_SUSPEND`, `DRMAA_CONTROL_RESUME` are only available for users being Slurm administrators
-   `drmaa_wct_slimit` not implemented
-   optional attributes `drmaa_deadline_time`, `drmaa_duration_hlimit`, `drmaa_duration_slimit`, `drmaa_transfer_files` not implemented
-   The SPANK client side (i.e. not remote) plugins chain is not invoked in DRMAA run job call. For this reason we advice you to use [TASK BLOCKS](http://code.google.com/p/slurm-spank-plugins/wiki/UseEnvSyntax#TASK_BLOCKS) in the `UseEnv` SPANK plugin.

Development and Pre-releases
----------------------------

Please note the `./autogen.sh` and `./autoclean.sh` scripts which calls the autotools command chain in appropriate order.

**note:** This repository depends on [DRMAA Utils](https://github.com/natefoo/drmaa-utils/), which is configured as a submodule. When cloning this repository, you should clone recursively, e.g.:

```console
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/natefoo/slurm-drmaa.git
```

**note:** You need some developer tools to compile the source from git, rather than from a tarball release. Also, the development version may not always compile.

### Developer tools

Although not needed for library user the following tools may be required if you intend to develop PSNC DRMAA for Slurm:

-   GNU autotools
    -   autoconf (tested with version 2.67)
    -   automake (tested with version 1.11)
    -   libtool (tested with version 2.2.8)
    -   m4 (tested with version 1.4.14)
-   [Bison](http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/) parser generator,
-   [RAGEL](http://www.complang.org/ragel/) State Machine Compiler,
-   [gperf](http://www.gnu.org/software/gperf/) gperf - a perfect hash function generator.

Authors
-------

The library was developed by:

-   Michal Matloka - first implementation
-   Mariusz Mamonski - maintainer since version 1.0.3
-   Piotr Kopta - maintainer since version 1.0.7

This library relies heavily on the *Fedstage DRMAA utils* code developed by:

-   Lukasz Ciesnik.
